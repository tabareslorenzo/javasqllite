# javasqllite

a. The purpose of this repo is to solve and showcase ms3 coding challenge.

b. I created the project in Eclipse. The project is in the eclipse-workspace directory. I used java 11 for this project. For the project to work sqllite jar file must be added to the eclipse project's external jar files.

c. At first I assumed that rows with empty columns were incorrect. After writing to the database and realizing that there were rows with more than 10 entries I marked those as incorrect instead.
